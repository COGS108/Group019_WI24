    "According to this scatterplot, there is a relationship between company size before layoffs and the percentage of employees laid off. However, this relationship appears negative, such that, as the size of the company before layoffs increases, the percentage of layoffs decreases. This contradicts our hypothesis and expectation that larger companies will have a higher percentage of layoffs. Given this initial relationship, we would like to measure the strength of association between company size before layoffs and the percentage of employees laid off."

This suggests that the company size before layoffs has only a minor impact on the percentage of layoffs. It seems that the correlation coefficient is the highest between the year of the layoffs and the percentage of layoffs. Given this week negative correlation, we are interested to see if there is a significant relationship between company size before layoffs and the percentage of employees laid off."

Given this p-value, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, concluding that larger companies before layoffs have lower percentage of layoffs. \n",

    "Nonetheless, this finding is different from what we hypothesized, as we expected larger companies to have a higher percentage of employee layoffs. One reason for the inverse relationship is that compared to smaller companies, larger companies have more employees to begin with, so if larger companies layoff more people than smaller companies, the percentage is not going to be as high. It is also important to consider other factors, such as industry type, geographic location, and economic condiitons, that could influence the relationship between company size before layoffs and the percentage of layoffs.
