We expect larger companies to layoff a higher percentage of employees than smaller companies because they will be able to raise more money and handle these layoffs, while the small companies would need their staff."

We chose to remove outliers because a majority of our data comes from smaller companies relative to others on the list. From our analysis, it appears there is a negative correlation between the two variables, though it is not a strong relationship. Furthermore, we observe that as a company receives more funding, the likelihood of layoffs decreases. The majority of the darker shaded blue squares are concentrated on the left side of the plot, where funding is lower."
