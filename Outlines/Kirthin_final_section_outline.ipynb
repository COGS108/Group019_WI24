We want to look at the percent laid off because, a larger company would have more employees than a small company so looking at percentage would give us a more accurate understanding of the relationshib between the two. We can see that there is a strong negative correlation between the two. There are two outliers on the far right. These big companies are necessary for the data, because we are looking at both big and small. We can also see that majoirty of the data is from companies raising below 40,000,000,000 in funding. "
